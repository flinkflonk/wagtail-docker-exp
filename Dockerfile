# adjust APP to your app name, my test server happens to be named www4.
# WORKERS is the number of gunicorn worers you need. This depends on
# the load and the complexity of your site's code.
# PORT is the (local) port you run your server on, which is backed
# by unicorn and fronted by a reverse proxy, either through apache's
# mod_proxy or nginx. I don't recommend exposing gunicorn directly
# to the interwebs.
# DEPLOYMENT is what kind of server this is, it's really just used
# to choose the correct wagtail (and by extension djago) settings.
